# Modeling_and_Simulation
The _main_ files include the executables for the simulations. The remaining elements such as EDA, model exploration, results and bootstrap util functions can be found in the associated folders. Furthermore, all dependencies used throughout the simulation study can be found in the _requirements.txt_ file to ensure reproducibility.
